IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing

Factory design model is applied in generating different types of visitors. I wrote a Person interface with getType() and like() method, and all four types of visitor including student, professor, business person and blogger implements this interface, from which we know the type of each visitor and their preference. PersonFactory class is used to create different visitors, and it has a method called getVisitor() whose return type is Person, which brings my first concern. For this method, I did three tests. Firstly, I tested that if the visitor to be created does not belong to one of the four types, null should be returned. Secondly, I confirmed that the newly created object is indeed an instance of Person. Thirdly, I tested that if a student created, it is really a student rather than a professor or other types. I don?t know if the second test is necessary since the third test is similar with the second one. Besides, for getVisitorList() method in VisitorList class that returns an array of Person, I tested the length of the array and make sure each element in this array is an instance of Person. Considering the fact that I have already tested the type of newly created object in getVisitor(), I didn?t test that here.

Another concern is about testing visitors? preference of locations. For each type of visitor, I tested the visitor?s preference for every place. Since testing every place is cheap and fast, I didn?t randomly pick one place the visitor and one place the visitor does not like to do the test. I am not sure if I have over tested it.

Initially, I am very confused about how to mock the random number generator in the LocGenerator class as I passed seed into the constructor when I first implemented my programs. The feedback from instructor strengthened my understanding of dependency injection. Now I passed the random number generator to the constructor and tested getIdx()and getPlace() correspondingly by using mocks.
